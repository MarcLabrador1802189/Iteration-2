- Day 1: Created simple sprite sheet for player
	 researched on control schemes
	 imported simple platforms
	 due to time constraints, i ensure the inputs, collision and player movement work before implementing everything else
	
	 if (spriteOver) {
	 	tint = red;
		if (p.jumpOut){
		 setVelocity = -500
		}
	 } else {
		tint = reset
	 }

         found a bug - where the button is being pressed, is not resetting colour. However when I fixed it by adjusting the IF,
	 I realised this can be an effective UX feature where player knows they're still jumping

- Day 2: Created a Method/Class List
	 Helps with placing in I/O Systems
	 Refer to GDD UI
	 UI Class - classes needed to be set up before unloading the config (my mistake when it runs)
	 I need to place all my objects in a new class
	setScale was helpful - change the size of the object
	new event learned: this.scene.launch(allows scene to run simulteneously)
	had to figure out the issue with left/right buttons



- Week 2: Tile Maps
	 Parallax
	 due to constraints - Imported premade assets from opengameart.org to shrink development time
